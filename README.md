Dynamic Hipster Quiz 2.0
=========================

A dynamic quiz using Javascript objects stored in an array, based on the tutorial "Learn Javascript Properly" at http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/. 

I refactored my original Hipster Quiz to use Javascript and JQuery to generate HTML for the form inputs and labels with the data stored as Javascript objects in an array of questions.

The task was to dynamically create a quiz consisting of questions with radio button options (I used 4 but the code does not rely on each question having the same number of select options) where a new question is shown each time the user clicks "next", and a final score is displayed after the last question, without reloading the page. The data comes from objects stored in an array, to practice generating HTML from data stored in data structures (as opposed to hard-coded HTML as in version 1 of the Hipster Quiz).
